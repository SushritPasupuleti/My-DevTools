## Neovim

My primary weapon of choice for a PDE (Personal Development Environment).

Full config [here](https://github.com/SushritPasupuleti/My-Neovim-Config).

## lazygit

My Git UI of choice. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a close second and more beginner friendly with all the features needed to work on your repo. My lazygit config can be found [here](https://github.com/SushritPasupuleti/Lazygit-Config).

Lazygit is lite and what I use when working remotely.

## Postman

Needs no introduction, just get [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to handle all your API Development needs (+ Websockets and more).

## PgAdmin

For working with `PostgreSQL` nothing else is as feature rich.

## [gping](https://github.com/orf/gping)

Visual Ping replacement.

## [timg](https://github.com/hzeller/timg)

View images in terminal in 24-Bit color via unicode blocks. Perfect for low-bandwidth SSH sessions.

Shows images in full resolution on iTerm2 and Kitty.

## [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/)

Renders webpages in your terminal via a firefox backend.
